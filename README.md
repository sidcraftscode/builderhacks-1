# Welcome

Welcome to Thea! Here is a short post on who, what, where, when, and why Thea came to be. We are trying to make a quick, efficient method of note-taking, to-do list, and all-in-one productivity app for students.

# Who?

Thea was co-founded by Edward Calzia, Siddharth Chaudhary and Aarav Kushagra. We hope to expand and try and get more people working at Thea! If you would like to join our team, make sure to email us at.

# What?

Thea is an all-in-one productivity tool with: notes, timetable, to-do list, calendar, and notices made for students. This free, open-source company aims to make an impact in educational tech.

# Where?

We are based in the United Kingdom, London and hope to impact countries all over the world in the future.

# When?

Thea was created on the 27th of February 2022 during a hackathon. We hope to update the product as frequently as possible.

# Why?

This project was made in order to:

- impact students by saving them time and money
- To give resources and productivity tips via our blog posts

# How?

Thea began as an MVP, and was focused entirely on education. As we expand into other growing sectors, our goals remain the same.
